# PSD Digits Recognition Project

This repository contains the source code of our work on the final year project on Data Science which aims to classify digits from images using Deep Learning technics.
Please find the MNIST data, which the model was trained on, on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) .
We trained the MNIST dataset on both CNN and a Fully Connected Network.
